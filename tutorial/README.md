# What is it

This is a quick tutorial to guide you how to deploy a smart contract and send some transaction.
Althogh we have already had the `Harmony-js` sdk, which is similar to `web3.js` or `ethers.js`, when it comes to DApp developement.
There are still steps to clearify, hope you can follow these steps and make things easier.



# Contract deployment steps

- Compile with `solcjs` or `truffle.js`
- Initializing `Harmony` instance with url and settings, and make `Wallet` work
- Construct a new Contract instance and setup transaction object
- Deploy and remember to save the contract address

# Contract call steps

- Methods and Events
- Use `Contract.methods.xxx` to call

# Address to address transaction

<TBD>
