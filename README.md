## Use command-line to test

Go to `nodejs` folder

There are 4 test scripts for testing

1. testWallet.js
2. testSign.js
3. testNode.js
4. testContract.js

open a console, use `node test{xxx}.js` to run the tests.

for example:

```bash
node testWallet.js
```

# Test with other tools
## Test with `ganache-cli`
** ganache-cli runs in js file **, 

In this case, we use ganache and ethereum's setting to simulate the result

We don't need harmony's testnode running.

1. open `nodejs`
2. run `node testGanache.js`
